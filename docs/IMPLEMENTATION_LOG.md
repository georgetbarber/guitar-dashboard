# Implementation log

The running record [section 15 of the implementation plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
asks for: one entry per work package, with its linked findings, acceptance
evidence and remaining limitations.

"Implemented" does not close a finding that still needs its verification.
Statuses: pending, in progress, implemented, verified locally, verified in CI,
needs musical/device/learner review, released, superseded.

## Phase 0 — verified starting point

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | Verified locally |
| **Findings** | All of B01–B32 given a disposition; none closed |
| **Depends on** | — |
| **Changed** | `docs/reviews/2026-09-10-phase-0-baseline.md` (new). Documentation only |
| **Evidence** | 94 unit tests pass; `tsc -b && vite build` clean; `npm audit` reports 18 advisories. Every finding's classification cites a line in the current source |
| **Migration impact** | None |
| **Limitations** | Firebase rules tests and browser journeys did not run on this path (Java 11 against the emulator's Java 21 requirement; no Playwright browsers). Accessibility findings B11–B16 were accepted from the audit rather than re-measured, and belong to Phase 2A. Live behaviour (B32) needs publication |

## Phase 1A — stable identity, and a truthful local save

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | Verified locally |
| **Findings** | B28 (closed pending CI), B02 (closed pending CI) |
| **Depends on** | Phase 0 |
| **Changed** | `src/v8/identity.ts`, `saveState.ts` (new), `components/SaveStatus.tsx` (new), `save.test.ts` (new); `repository.ts`, `store.tsx`, `learning.ts`, `features/Create.tsx`, `app/App.tsx`, `styles/app.css` |
| **Evidence** | 110 unit tests pass (94 before, 16 in the new file); build clean. Each of the four repaired defects was reintroduced individually in a scratch copy and failed exactly its own test and no other |
| **Migration impact** | None. Existing IDs are read and written unchanged; only newly created records use the new form. No schema or rules change |

### What changed, and why

**Identity (B28).** All five creation sites — sketch, revision, chord event,
take, observation — now call `newId(kind)`. The previous
`${kind}-${Date.now()}` form collides whenever two records of a kind are made
inside one millisecond, which every transformation button in Create does
(it writes a revision and updates the sketch in one click). The sketch ID was
worse: it mixed in `sketches.length`, so deleting a sketch and creating another
returned the index to a used value and reproduced a whole ID. Because these IDs
are Firestore document keys and recording blob keys, a collision overwrites one
record with another silently, in the cloud and on the device.

`newId` falls back to `getRandomValues` where `randomUUID` is missing.
`randomUUID` requires a secure context, which excludes the dev server reached
over a LAN address — the exact route for testing on a phone in Phase 7.

**Local save (B02).** The store discarded the save promise's rejection
(`.catch(() => undefined)`), so a device that could store nothing was
indistinguishable from one that had just saved, while the interface asserted
"changes save automatically on this device" and the offline banner said work was
"safe on this device".

Now:

- `savePersistedState` reports **where** the write landed. A localStorage
  fallback is no longer reported as equivalent to a durable IndexedDB write —
  it holds a few megabytes at best and will start refusing a growing sketchbook.
- `saveState.ts` holds the transitions as pure functions. A failure preserves
  `lastSavedAt` and `medium`, because they describe the copy already on the
  device, which a failed write does not touch.
- `runSave` is the single path by which an outcome is reported. Every branch
  either reports or is deliberately silent, and silence only happens when a
  newer save has superseded this one and will report the truth for a superset of
  the same edits. No branch discards a rejection.
- The unsaved state is held before the write begins and released only once it is
  durable, so a retry resends exactly what failed rather than a newer partial.
- Switching workspace retires any in-flight save and drops the unsaved copy, so
  one workspace's result cannot be reported against another, and a retry cannot
  write one workspace's work into another.
- `SaveIndicator` states the device's status in the sidebar, permanently and
  separately from the cloud badge. `SaveFailureAlert` appears only on failure
  and offers a retry and a recovery-file download.
- Copy that asserted durability was corrected in `App.tsx` and `Create.tsx`.

### Limitations

- Not verified in CI, on a real device, or against the Firebase emulator.
- The recovery file omits recordings this device can no longer read. The
  interface says so; it is not silently a partial backup.
- `runSave` is covered through its seam rather than by rendering the provider.
  A DOM test environment does not exist in this repository yet; adding one is
  Phase 2B work (B23).
- B02's sibling promises are **not** addressed here and remain open:
  `buildSession` still ignores `settings.dailyMinutes` (B01), the Create
  transformation controls still only append prose (B05), and `newSketch` still
  hard-codes C major rather than inheriting the tonal context (B10). All three
  belong to Phase 1E.

## Next package

**Phase 1B — validation and bounded data.** It begins by adopting
`src/v8/validation.ts`, which is present in the tree and imported by nothing, so
the app currently validates no persisted, imported or cloud data at all. Wiring
it in changes what the app accepts from storage, so it needs 1B's isolation and
recovery behaviour built alongside it: a rejected cloud record must not stall
unrelated valid work, and oversized legacy material must be preserved and
exportable rather than discarded.
